* Differences between Data and Information

Data are raw facts without any context. On the contrary, pieces of information are processed data with meaning. 

* Explain the types of databases.

    There are many kinds of databases but the common types are :  
        Relational Database: Data are stored here in the table and relationships are maintained. (e.g. MySQL, Postgres)
        NoSQL Database: Data are stored here without any structure. (e.g. MongoDB)
        Distributed Database: Data are distributed here across different locations.
        Cloud Database: Data are hosted here in the cloud platform. (e.g. AWS)

* What is DBMS?

    DBMS(Data Base Management System) is a software where we can store and manage data. 

* What is RDBMS?

    RDBMS(Relational Data Base Management System) is also a software where we can store and manage databases in the table in a more structured way. 

* Differences between DBMS and RDBMS.

    In a database management system data aren’t stored in the table and don’t maintain any relationship. On the other hand, in a relational database management system data are stored in the table and relationships are maintained. 

* Use cases of DBMS and RDBMS.

    For Single user applications or file based system we should use DBMS and for multi user application and complex systems like Bank management, we should use RDBMS.

* What is SQL?

    SQL(Structured Query Language) is a language to maintain and manipulate relational database.

* What is NoSQL?

    NoSQL refers to database that stores data in formats other than table, like documents or key value pairs.

* Differences between SQL and NoSQL

	SQL: structured, uses table, maintain relationship.
	NoSQL: unstructured, flexibleschemas, doesn’t maintain relationship.

* Use cases of SQL and NoSQL

    SQL : We should use SQL where we need to manage data in more structured way (e.g. Banking System )
    NoSQL : We should use NoSQL where we need to manage data in more flexible way (e.g. Social Media )

* What is MySQL 

    MySQL is an open source rational database management system that uses SQL

* Differences between SQL and MySQL
	
    SQL is a language that manages rational data and MySQL is a relational database management system that uses SQL

* What is key?

	Key is a field that identifies records in a table.

* What is the Primary Key?

	Primary key is a unique field that identifies each record in a table.

* What is Foreign Key?

	Foreign Key is field linking two table by referencing the primary key of another table.

* What is a Unique Key?

    A unique key is a field or set of fields that ensures all values in a column are unique. Unlike primary key it can contain null value. 

* What is Candidate Key?

    A candidate key is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identifies each records in a table. It is a candidate for primary key.

* What is Composite Key?

    A combination of two or more columns to create a unique key when a single column is not sufficient.

* Differences between Composite key and Foreign key

    Composite Key: Used to link records from one table to another by referencing a primary key.
    Foreign Key:  Used to link records from one table to another by referencing a primary key.

* Types of relation in SQL

    One-to-One
    One-to-Many
    Many-to-Many


* Explain one-to-one relation

	Each record in one table is related to only one record in another table.

* Explain one-to-many relation

	Each record in one table is related to multiple records in another table.

* Explain many-to-many relation

	Multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table.

* What are the common types of SQL 

	DQL(Data Query Language)
	DDL(Data Definition Language)
	DML(Data Manipulation Language)
	DCL(Data Control Language)	

* What is DQl?

	A subset of SQL is used to query and retrieve data. Example: SELECT.

* What is DCL?

	A subset of SQL that is used to manage permissions in the database. Examples: GRANT.

* What is DDL?

    A subset of SQL is used to define and modify the database structure. Examples: CREATE

* What DML?

    A subset of SQL that is used to manage data within tables. Examples: INSERT

* Different types of RDBMS

    MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite are popular RDBMS that support SQL-based queries for relational data.

* What is SQL insection?

    SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into an application's input fields, which gets executed on the database

* What is WHERE clause?
* What is Having clause?
* What is JOIN in SQL?
* Explain different kinds of JOIN query?
* What is Data constraints?
* What are some common clauses used with SELECT query in SQL?
